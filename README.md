# MZF2WAVGUI
Uses MZF2WAV to convert mzf/mzt files for Sharp MZ computers to wav files, and allows you to play them. A bit like a tape emulator to use with MZs.

It uses [Jeroen Laros's 15 year old MZF to WAV converter command](https://github.com/jfjlaros/mzf2wav), but adds a fancy new GUI. Thanks Jeroen for your support
Thanks Bernd Kr√ºger-Knauber for permission to use MZTtoMZF for mzt conversion

How to use:

1. Unzip MZF2WAVGUI and install the setup.exe
2. PLEASE BACKUP YOUR MZ FILES BEFORE USE
3. Load an MZF/MZT file (freely available on the internet, or use one of the built-in ones)
4. Save the file to WAV format locally or to media player
5. If you are planning to use an MZuiTape device, use the `-c` and `-b` or the MZuiTape option

# Version History 
 - v1.5 now has batch conversion mode to convert multiple files in one job. I've attached a video showing how it works.
 - V1.5.5 Now supports MZT files
